# This game is Not Rocketscience!

This started out as a [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) playground and turns into a 2D spaceship-flying game.

## Setup

The standard setup relies on [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html) being present. Simply run ``setup.sh``: 

* creates a local conda environment ``_venv``
* installs dependencies from ``requirements.txt`` into it
* does a editable install of the package ``src/not_rocketscience``, so it can be imported in the ``_venv``environment

## Running something

Pick one of the scripts from the ``run`` folder.
